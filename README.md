# Anemometer Signal Processor

Arduino (C++) code that reads signals from anemometer and send translated data to server.

## Functionality
- Reads digital and analog signals from anemometer
- Converts these signals into voltages and display on LCD
- Transform voltages into windspeed and direction
- Send data to server using MQTT protocol
